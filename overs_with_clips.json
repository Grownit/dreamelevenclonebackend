The third ump's view is that Jadeja was watching the ball and aware of where it was heading. So in his mind he's convinced Jadeja deliberately changed direction. Was that the case though? Need another look at it. Seemed like it was a natural angle that Jadeja was taking. Since he was turning back, he was obviously going to have a look at where the ball was heading. He has a polite enquiry with the ump on seeing the giant screen display OUT and walks off. This is going to be controversial.
